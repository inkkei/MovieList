          This website was created by a movie lover for movie lovers. I really
          hope it will help you organize your lists of movies and shows. How
          many times has it happened that you don't know what to watch and have
          to spend minutes and hours looking for the right movie? This site is
          designed to save you time and organize a space where you can save
          movies you've watched, save movies you want to watch and pick
          recommendations based on your preferences.
        </p>

          P.S. This site is still being finalized. I have a lot of ideas for
          additional functionality, but if you have any wishes or notice any
          errors - you can always contact me:
          <span>
            <a href="mailto: imgnlenn@gmail.com"> Send Email </a>
          </span>
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
};
